Donating blood is a simple thing to do, but can make a big difference in the lives of others. The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour. The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average. The steps in the process are:

Registration

    You will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number, and donor identification number (if you have one).
    You will be asked to show a donor card, driver’s license or two other forms of ID.

Health History and Mini Physical

    You will answer some questions during a private and confidential interview about your health history and the places you have traveled.
    You will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.

Donation

    We will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.
    You will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2 hours.)
    When approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.

Refreshments

    You will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight decrease in fluid volume.
    After 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities.
    Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.

Your gift of blood may help up to three people. Donated red blood cells do not last forever. They have a shelf-life of up to 42 days. A healthy donor may donate every 56 days.

                    In most states, donors must be age 17 or older. Some states allow donation by 16-year-olds with a signed parental consent form. Donors must weigh at least 110 pounds and be in good health. Additional eligibility criteria apply.

                    The entire process takes about one hour and 15 minutes; the actual donation of a pint of whole blood unit takes eight to 10 minutes. However, the time varies slightly with each person depending on several factors including the donor’s health history and attendance at the blood drive.

                    You must wait at least eight weeks (56 days) between donations of whole blood and 16 weeks (112 days) between Power Red donations. Whole blood donors can donate up to 6 times a year. Platelet apheresis donors may give every 7 days up to 24 times per year. Regulations are different for those giving blood for themselves (autologous donors).
